                                 Smirk
                          version 1.2 by DEATH

Introduction
-------------
Smirk is a desktop switcher for Windows NT/2000/XP. It allows you to use
up to 4 desktops with very easy accessibility and simplicity.

Usage
------
Just run Smirk.exe . A notification icon should appear, from there you can
choose which desktop to switch to. You can also switch desktops using the
keyboard combination CTRL + ALT + F1/F2/F3/F4 .

If for some reason Smirk doesn't work, or shows an error, contact me.

Some notes:
    If the close shell option is disabled:
    The shell instances will still exist after you exit Smirk, if you
    re-enter Smirk, it will use them.

    If the close children option is disabled:
    The shell child processes will still exist after you exit Smirk.

History
--------
1.0     -   Initial release.
1.1     -   Minor bugfixes
        -   Added desktop descriptions (instead of Desktop 0/1/2/3)
        -   "Smirk cannot detect when the shell is ready to install the
             notification icon. It will try to install it when the user
             switches a desktop, unless the desktop already exists,
             then the shell will surely be ready."
            This is fixed. Smirk now accepts the taskbar creation
            notification message.
1.2     -   Minor bugfix on shell start-up.
        -   Smirk can now close the shell and/or its child processes.
            Notice: Smirk will only close the shell if it was created by
            the same Smirk instance.
        -   Internal source code redesign.
1.x     -   Now includes a better process closing module.
